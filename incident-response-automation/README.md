# Incident Response Automation Suite

Comprehensive incident response automation platform for threat detection, analysis, and automated response capabilities.

## Overview

The Incident Response Automation Suite provides automated security incident detection, analysis, and response capabilities. It integrates with existing security tools and follows industry-standard incident response frameworks (NIST, SANS).

## Features

### 🔍 **Threat Detection**
- Real-time log analysis and correlation
- Anomaly detection using behavioral baselines
- Integration with SIEM platforms (ELK Stack, Splunk)
- Custom detection rules and signatures

### 🚨 **Incident Analysis**
- Automated threat classification and severity scoring
- Evidence collection and preservation
- Timeline reconstruction and attack path analysis
- Threat intelligence enrichment

### ⚡ **Automated Response**
- Configurable response playbooks
- Automated containment actions
- Network isolation and quarantine
- Evidence preservation and forensic imaging

### 📊 **Reporting & Compliance**
- Automated incident reports
- Compliance framework mapping (SOC2, PCI DSS, NIST)
- Executive dashboards and metrics
- Forensic evidence chain of custody

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start incident response monitor
python -m incident_response monitor --config config.yaml

# Run threat detection
python -m incident_response detect --source syslog

# Execute response playbook
python -m incident_response respond --incident INC-2024-001 --playbook malware_containment
```

## Detection Capabilities
