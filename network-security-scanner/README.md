# Network Security Scanner

A comprehensive network security scanning tool for vulnerability assessment, port scanning, and security configuration analysis.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**: TCP/UDP port discovery and service enumeration
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Common vulnerability detection
- **SSL/TLS Analysis**: Certificate validation and cipher suite analysis
- **Network Discovery**: Host discovery and network mapping
- **Security Policy Validation**: Firewall and security group analysis

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Basic port scan
python -m network_scanner scan --target 192.168.1.1

# Vulnerability assessment
python -m network_scanner vuln --target example.com

# SSL/TLS analysis
python -m network_scanner ssl --target https://example.com
```

## Architecture

The scanner follows a modular plugin architecture similar to the AWS Security Suite:

```
network-security-scanner/
├── core/           # Core scanning engine
├── plugins/        # Scanning modules
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── reports/        # Report generators
└── tests/          # Test suite
```

## Security Considerations

- **Ethical Use**: Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to avoid overwhelming targets
- **Stealth Options**: Configurable scan timing and detection avoidance
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all scanning activities

## Compliance

This tool is designed to support security assessments according to:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- OWASP Testing Guide
- CIS Controls
- PCI DSS requirements
