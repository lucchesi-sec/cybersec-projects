# Screenshots Directory

This directory is intended to store screenshots that demonstrate the effectiveness of the ModSecurity WAF implementation.

In a real implementation, you would add your own screenshots here showing:

1. Attacks being blocked by ModSecurity
2. WAF logs showing detection of attack attempts
3. Before/after comparisons of vulnerable application responses

Since this is a demonstration project, no actual screenshots are included. The `before-after.md` document in the parent directory explains conceptually what you would expect to see when implementing this solution.
