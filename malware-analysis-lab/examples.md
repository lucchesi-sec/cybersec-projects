# Usage Examples

This document provides examples of how to use the Basic Malware Analysis Lab.

## Basic Analysis

To perform a basic analysis on a file:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the malware-analysis-lab directory
cd malware-analysis-lab

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the analyzer on the test sample
python src/analyzer.py samples/test_sample.txt
```

## Expected Output

When analyzing the provided test sample, you should see:
1. Basic file information (size, type, hashes)
2. YARA rule matches (suspicious strings, APIs, etc.)
3. Extracted strings from the file

## Analyzing Custom Files

You can analyze any file by providing its path:

```bash
python src/analyzer.py path/to/your/file
```

## Analysis of PE Files

For PE (Windows executable) files, you'll get additional information:
- Machine type
- Compilation timestamp
- Section information (including entropy)

## VirusTotal Integration

To check files against VirusTotal's database:

```bash
# Set your VirusTotal API key
export VT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Run the analyzer
python src/analyzer.py samples/test_sample.txt
```

## Safety Precautions

Always follow these safety precautions:
1. Use in an isolated environment
2. Never analyze unknown files on your main system
3. Consider using a virtual machine for analysis
4. Only analyze files you trust or in a safe laboratory environment

## Interpreting Results

- High entropy sections (>7.0) may indicate packing or encryption
- Multiple YARA rule matches increase suspicion level
- Suspicious API calls may indicate malicious behavior
- Anti-debugging techniques often indicate evasive malware

Remember: This tool performs static analysis only - no code is executed.
