# Cybersecurity Projects

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This repository contains hands-on security projects focused on practical skills in system hardening, cloud security, and compliance. Each project is designed to demonstrate real-world security practices beyond certifications and theory.

The goal is to build a portfolio of work that reflects both technical ability and security mindset.

### [Linux Server Hardening Lab](./linux-server-hardening/)
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-Hardening-yellow)

Hardened a Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 ARM) virtual machine using common security best practices:
- SSH key-only login
- Firewall configuration (UFW)
- Fail2ban for brute-force protection
- Automatic security updates
- Password policy enforcement (complexity + aging)
- Audit logging with `auditd`
- Legal warning banner for compliance

Includes configuration files, audit logs, and an automation script to collect these configs from the VM.

### [SSH Key Rotation Automation](./ssh-key-rotation/)
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-Automation-yellow)

An automated script for rotating SSH keys on Linux servers with safety and audit logging features:
- Supports multiple old keys via `old-keys.txt`.
- Automatically detects old key fingerprints and matches against the server's `authorized_keys`.
- Backs up the existing `authorized_keys` before any changes.
- Prompts per old key found before removal to prevent accidental lockouts.
- Full session logging for auditability.

### [Password Strength Analyzer](./password-analyzer/)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11-blue)

A Python-based tool for comprehensive password security evaluation according to NIST and OWASP guidelines:
- Password scoring against security best practices
- Detection of common patterns and vulnerabilities
- Entropy calculation and complexity analysis
- Secure password generation capabilities
- Interactive CLI with detailed recommendations

Includes test suite, dictionary data, and educational security guidance.
