# Cybersecurity Projects

This repository contains hands-on security projects focused on practical skills in system hardening, cloud security, and compliance. Each project is designed to demonstrate real-world security practices beyond certifications and theory.

The goal is to build a portfolio of work that reflects both technical ability and security mindset.

### âœ… [Linux Server Hardening Lab](./linux-server-hardening/)
Hardened a Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 ARM) virtual machine using common security best practices:
- SSH key-only login
- Firewall configuration (UFW)
- Fail2ban for brute-force protection
- Automatic security updates
- Password policy enforcement (complexity + aging)
- Audit logging with `auditd`
- Legal warning banner for compliance

Includes configuration files, audit logs, and an automation script to collect these configs from the VM.
