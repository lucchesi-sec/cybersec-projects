# Security Workflow Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the security scanning workflow in this repository.

## Key Changes

1.  **Replaced Flawed Dependency Scan:** The previous `dependency-scan` job, which only generated a dependency graph without performing any actual vulnerability scanning, has been replaced with the `actions/dependency-review-action`. This new action will properly scan for vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies and can be configured to fail builds or warn developers based on the severity of the findings.

2.  **Added Proactive Secret Scanning:** A new `trufflehog-scan` job has been added to the workflow. This job uses the `trufflesecurity/trufflehog` action to scan the repository for any accidentally committed secrets. This will help prevent the exposure of sensitive credentials.

3.  **Improved Security Reporting:** The `report` job has been updated to generate a more accurate and informative security report. The new report will reflect the actual status of the `codeql-analysis`, `dependency-vulnerability-scan`, and `trufflehog-scan` jobs, providing a clear overview of the repository's security posture.

## Next Steps

- Monitor the new security workflow to ensure it is functioning as expected.
- Address any new security alerts that are generated by the improved scanning capabilities.
- Continue to refine and improve the security workflow as new tools and best practices emerge.
